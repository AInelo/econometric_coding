    "Before discussing simultaneous-equation models, we should clarify some terminologies that are commonly seen in macroeconomic literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **identification** was originally a statistical term which describes a model with multiple sets of parameters, but generates the same distribution, therefore the parameters can't be identified by investigating the generated observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In econometric research, identification concerns more about identifying the causality, especially in multiple equation models. For easy demonstration, below is a time series model of three equations. The subscript $t$ represents the time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all called **structural model**, because they may portray the structure of economy or behaviors of an economic agent."

But in practice, the researchers themselves should classify variables based on theoretical grounds or experience."
