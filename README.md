# Basic Econometrics With Python [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/apm/l/atomic-design-ui.svg?)]()
[last updated in 26th Oct 2021]<br>
These lecture notes are intended for introductory econometrics course, suitable for university/grad students, data/quantitative analysts, junior business/economic/financial researchers and etc. 

The lectures notes are loosely based on several textbooks:<br>

1. <b><i>Introduction to Econometrics</i></b>,  by Christopher Dougherty<br>
2. <b><i>Introduction to Econometrics</i></b>,  by James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson<br>
3. <b><i>Basic Econometrics</i></b>,  by Damodar N. Gujarati

## Prerequisites
Though the lectures are introductory level, it would be ideal that attendants have a slight exposure to probability theory and statistics.

And you would benefit more from the tutorials if you have basic knowledge of: 
- [x] NumPy
- [x] Matplotlib
- [x] Pandas
